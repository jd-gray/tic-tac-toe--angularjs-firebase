GA WDI Project 1 - Tic Tac Toe
==============================

Objectives:

-Render a game board in the browser.
-Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select).
-Declare a winner if a player gets three in a row, cat's game if neither does.
-Allow for two players to compete on separate devices.

The above submitted files include an AngularJS version of Tic Tac Toe which is on firebase. This version allows for 1vs1 player compatibility. If a third player attempts to join, they will be transferred to my person website: www.jaredgray.us.
